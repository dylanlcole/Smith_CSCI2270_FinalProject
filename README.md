# Smith_CSCI2270_FinalProject
final project

Similar to the Zombie Cities project, a graph will be created with different cities connected with different weights.
The user will be placed start at a city in the graph and given a destination city. The user will choose an adjacent city to travel until he/she reaches the destination.
The total distance traveled will be recorded and displayed, along with the minimum distance possible.
